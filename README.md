# Solarnet School 2019 El Teide : Deep Learning

## Slides
The slides are provided as a Keynote file and also a 
pdf that does not contain the animations. In this repository
you can find the pdf version while the Keynote file with all
the possible animations can be found in https://owncloud.iac.es/index.php/s/5TmMZzr7XNc04Lm

## Notebook
A notebook with some examples of simple regressions with
neural networks and a classification can be found in the repository.
They use the deep learning package PyTorch for the training. The notebook
can also be found on Google Collab on https://bit.ly/2Kh35Kv.

## Exercises
You can experiment with the previous notebook to understand
how simple neural networks can be defined in PyTorch and
how they can be used to solve regression/classification 
problems.

Some interesting experiments:

- Modify the architectures by changing the number
of neurons in the hidden layers.
- Change the activation functions and check how the results are modified.
